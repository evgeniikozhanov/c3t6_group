# Classes and methods for math groups with C3-T6 conditions

On the current moment, only an alphabet and constitutive relations of the C3-T6 group are supported.

But I plan:
- to add checking C3-T6 conditions;
- to add a way to create words from the alphabet;
- to add a way to raise words to a power;
- to add a way to mix words after raised to a power;
- to add a way to provide R-cuttings.

This theory is described in articles by Nikolai Bezverhnii
