# Classes and methods for math groups with C(3)-T(6) conditions

-------------

#### C(3) and T(6) conditions.
Please see the chapter Non-metric small cancellation conditions
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_cancellation_theory

#### The following functionality has been implemented:
- an alphabet and constitutive relations of the C3-T6 group are supported
- when you create a C3-T6 group, all constitutive relations will be generated
- checking C(3) conditions was added

#### I plan to develop:
- to add checking T(6) conditions;
- to add a way to create words from the alphabet;
- to add a way to raise words to a power;
- to add a way to mix words after raised to a power;
- to add a way to provide R-cuttings.

This theory is described in articles by Nikolai Bezverhnii
